# Simple File Management Tool

This is a simple file management tool using Node.js core modules (`fs`, `path`, and `http`). It can create, read, and delete files through HTTP requests.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `file_system.js` file.
2. Ensure you have a directory called `files` in the same directory as `file_system.js`, or let the code create it automatically.

## Usage

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `file_system.js`.
2. Run the server with the following command:
   ```bash
   node file_system.js
